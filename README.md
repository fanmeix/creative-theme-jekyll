#Disclaimer:
This is a Jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com).

#Introduction:
This document provides a technical overview of the design and implementation of my personal website, created as the final project for CS50. The goal was to create a portfolio site that is functional, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to maintain. This is a Design README that documents the structural, stylistic, and functional aspects of the project and explains the design decisions made throughout the development process. A separate README file explains the project and access methods.

#Project Structure:
The project is organized into the following files and directories:
- index.html: The main HTML file that structures the website content.
- style.css: The stylesheet that defines the website's design and layout.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that handles interactivity and dynamic elements.
- assets/: A directory for images and other media used throughout the website.
- README.md: The user documentation file.

#Design Principles:
- Simplicity: nothing fancy needed for a personal website (for a boring academic). The point is that people get to find information about me, what I do, and easy access to my research. 
- Accessibility: inclusive design principle, such as alt text for images to support screen readers.
- Flexibility: the web is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy changes in the future.

#Implementation:
- HTML: The HTML file uses semantic elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer> for clarity. Each section of the website (About, Portfolio, Skills, Contact) is wrapped in a <section> tag, making it easy to navigate and style.
- CSS: A custom CSS file (style.css) was created instead of relying on a framework to retain full control over the design. CSS layout techniques were used for alignment and such.
- JavaScript: For interactive components (e.g. Event Listener)

#Design
- Color Palette: A harmonious color palette was chosen to ensure a professional appearance.
- Inclusive design principle: still needs improvements.
